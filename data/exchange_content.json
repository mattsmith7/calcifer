The accuracy of the default SRTM database of UgCS varies, therefore to enable precise and safe flight altitude precise DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data has to be imported of the survey area.\n\nImport DEM for safer mission planning\nThe terrain is always changing, but changes are not always implemented into 3D maps as fast as it is needed. To plan an automated low altitude or mission with terrain following for the purposes of mapping, surveying or monitoring, import Digital Elevation Model (DEM) into UgCS to plan safe missions.\n\nGeoreferenced image import as Map overlays\nTo fly automated drone missions precise maps are more important than ever. Import GeoTIFF images as map overlay into UgCS, providing the power to customize the maps to suit your needs. \n\nMission planner | Drone control\n\nImmersive 3D mission planning environment\nUgCS features mission planner with a Google Earth-like 3D interface for UAV mission planning, enabling to navigate the environment more easily. Moreover, a 3D mission planning environment gives more control allowing to view the created flight plan from all angles, taking into account any obstacles such as terrain or buildings.\n\nDrone survey planning tools\nUgCS offers tools to make aerial surveys and mapping as easy and effortless as possible. Choose one of the pre-installed camera profiles or create a new one to suit your camera. The LiDAR, Photogrammetry, Corridor mapping, Vertical scan, and Area Scan tools will automatically calculate the flight path based on the drone and camera settings. Alternatively, the Area Scan and Photogrammetry parameters can be adjusted manually, such as GSD, overlap, or desired altitude.\n\nFacade scan tool\nThe tool for vertical scanning allows to plan a vertical plane, specify the distance to the wall, as well as side and forward overlap. The optimal flying path is calculated automatically. UgCS supports importing 3D object and custom DEM data with the terrain following function. The tool is also extremely useful in mining for examining open quarries.\n\nTelemetry window\nThe telemetry data window in UgCS displays telemetry data including the charge level of the battery, radio link and GPS signal quality, current course and heading, speed, altitude and much more.\n\nElevation profile\nOnce UgCS completes the flight path calculation the elevation profile of the route displays the AGL and AMSL altitude of the drone. The exact altitudes above sea level at all points provides the ability to plan drone missions with respect to the surrounding.\n\nAutomatic flight mode (waypoints) and direct drone control\nUgCS enables multiple flight modes. The manual flight mode allows controlling the drone with the remote control. Once a flight plan is created and uploaded to the autopilot the Automatic flight mode can be used. For many drones, UgCS also supports Click&Go and Joystick control flight modes.\n\nSoftware emulator\nThere are in-built software emulators for quadrocopters and fixed wing drones -emucopter and emuplane. It enables to test a route before uploading it to a real drone. Feel free to test diverse features and settings of UgCS in a safe environment.\n\nPost-flight analysis and Image processing\n\nGeotagging\nUgCS has an in-build geotagging tool, allowing to sync the timestamps of the images with the autopilot's telemetry data recorded during the flight. After matching the geotags with coordinates and correct altitudes, the images can be used for the further processing. Create map overlays or 3D models to import them into UgCS for more precise mission planning.\n\nTelemetry player\nAll telemetry data of the flights is recorded in UgCS, enabling to replay the flights of the drone during the flight.\n\nNo-Fly zones\n\nNo-Fly zones - airport registry\nUgCS has built-in No-Fly zones (NFZ) for all major airports, enabling a safe flight planning near airports since the flight path will automatically be calculated around the no-fly zone. Airport no-fly zones can be disabled in UgCS PRO and UgCS ENTERPRISE.\n\nCreate custom No-Fly zones\nUgCS option to create own custom no-fly zones (NFZ) enables to specify regions where flights are prohibited. UgCS will automatically calculate flight path avoiding these areas and make sure that the drone does not enter NFZ while on an automated flight.\n\nFly zone limits for routes\nSet boundaries for the flights starting from the first waypoint.

In this mode, you repeatedly take sets of pictures, upload them to a folder and they are automatically processed. A preview is displayed and you can decide which part of the model needs more detail. Then, you take more pictures and the whole process repeats until you\u2019ve captured the model from all angles.\n\nImporting images into Meshroom is simply a drag & drop from your images folder into Meshroom. Your Meshroom projects will be saved in a folder called MeshroomCache. And that\u2019s pretty much it! Meshroom will go through your images\u2019 metadata to ensure they are all in order and get to work processing the 3D image.\n\nWhatever is uploaded is automatically opened in Meshroom\u2019s UI. You can then go through in more detail and see what images correspond to what location on the 3D scan. The examination of individual images in the 3D scan gives you more control and a better idea of what looks good and what doesn't.\n\nMake sure to explore the different node functions and how they can be used to improve or change your image. After you are satisfied with the results, go to the next step: uploading straight to Sketchfab.\n\nMeshroom has a feature where you can directly upload your image results to Sketchfab to publish your 3D models and projects.", "tags": "{3D Models, Camera, Free, Linux, Local Software, macOS, Open Source, Photogrammetry, Processing, Windows}", "feature tags": NaN, "detailed features": NaN, "prices": NaN, "works well with": "{Sketchfab}"}, {"id": 10037, "name": "GeoSLAM Draw", "company": "GeoSLAM", "description": "Enhance and gain more insight from point clouds.", "about": "GeoSLAM Draw is an optional ad on to GeoSLAM Connect for creating and visualizing 2D and 3D models of physical spaces using laser scanning and other geospatial technologies.

The mapping tool allows users to create a digital map of their farm, including fields and features, and share it with their team. The platform automatically records length and area measurements and allows users to record crops or livestock in their fields, make cropping plans, and refer to past cropping data. The reporting feature allows users to access all their farm records in one place and track input use per field and cross-farm, monitor input use for compliance, easily check which jobs an input was used on, and review what was applied to fields by year for costings. The Plan Farm Work tool helps farmers plan and track their field work and other tasks on the farm, with a field history feature that keeps a timeline of everything that has been done in a field. The Livestock Management tool allows farmers to record and track animal numbers, locations, and movements on their farm, and helps them monitor herd movements and calculate field rest days. The Scouting and Measurement tool allows users to create located notes with pictures for scouting and tracking observations and issues on the farm, and to set up monitoring sites to track data on the farm. The tool also allows users to use satellite imagery to spot problems and go directly to the issue when in the field.\n\nMapping\nA digital mapping tool that allows users to create a map of their farm, including fields and features, and share it with their team. The map is accessible on smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Users can quickly and easily map their farm in just 30 minutes (UK only) by importing field boundaries from RPA or John Deere and adding detail with features such as fences, gateways, buildings, and water pipes. The platform automatically records length and area measurements. Users can give access to their farm map to workers, agronomists, advisers, or contractors and access it on their own devices, saving time and helping team members navigate and avoid hazards. GeoMaps also allows users to record crops or livestock in their fields, make cropping plans, and refer to past cropping data to ensure proper rotations. Fields can be divided into sub-fields for various purposes, and users can set field usages, grazing, and field jobs per sub-field for more detailed records. All farm map information can be stored in one place by uploading scanned maps or PDFs, drone imagery using the Drone Deploy integration, yield maps, and regularly updated NDVI analysis with Field Health.\n\nReporting\nA reporting feature that allows users to access all their farm records in one place, ready for use in ordering, costings, benchmarking, or auditing. The platform helps users focus on understanding the impact of their actions on performance rather than searching through paperwork. Users can track input use per field and cross-farm, monitor input use to ensure compliance with legal limits, easily check which jobs an input was used on, know the amount of product required for the season, and review what was applied to fields by year for costings. The platform also automatically records who completed a job and when it was completed. Users can record and compare yields by field, automatically calculate the farm's total yield, visualize yield data with graphs to compare performance, and record yield data over the years. Fieldmargin also provides a history of each field and allows users to easily look back at work done on fields. Users can generate spreadsheets of their reports for paper copies, costings analysis, gross margin calculation, and farm benchmarking.\n\nPlan Farm Work\nHelps farmers plan and track their field work and other tasks on the farm. It allows users to plan key field operations, input information about materials used, add comments and photos, and use a personal to-do list to stay organized. It also has a field history feature that keeps a timeline of everything that has been done in a field. The goal of the tool is to help farmers spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on farming.\n\nLivestock Management\nThe livestock management tool allows farmers to record and track animal numbers, locations, and movements on their farm. It enables users to set up herds with animal type and count, and to record the location of animals on a map. The tool also helps farmers monitor herd movements and calculate field rest days to estimate grazing availability. Additionally, it allows users to record important information such as livestock treatments and pasture productivity improvements, and to track hay and silage yields. This tool is useful for managing various types of livestock, including sheep, cattle, and horses.\n\nScouting and Measurement\nAllows users to create located notes with pictures for scouting and tracking observations and issues on the farm. These notes can be quickly recorded and include photos to show details of the issue. Users can use their phone location to drop a pin or draw a shape on a map to show problem areas.
