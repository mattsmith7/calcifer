10009,Instant NeRF,Nvidia,Neural rendering model that learns a high-resolution 3D scene in seconds — and can render images of that scene in a few milliseconds.,"Nvidia Instant NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) turns a collection of still 2D photos or videos into 3D digital scenes in a matter of seconds.

Instant NeRF uses AI to approximate how light behaves in the real world, enabling you to reconstruct a 3D scene from a handful of 2D images taken at different angles. The NVIDIA Research team has developed an approach that accomplishes this task almost instantly — making it one of the first models of its kind to combine ultra-fast neural network training and rapid rendering.

NVIDIA applied this approach to a popular new technology called neural radiance fields, or NeRF. The result, dubbed Instant NeRF, is the fastest NeRF technique to date, achieving more than 1,000x speedups in some cases. The model requires just seconds to train on a few dozen still photos  — plus data on the camera angles they were taken from — and can then render the resulting 3D scene within tens of milliseconds.

Instant NeRF has a basic GUI once a model is launched, however installation and general usage of the tool is best suited towards users with at least some basic coding experience. There are enough community guides and tutorials that a less technical user could still get themselves started into Instant NeRF.

Notes:
- Currently Instant NeRF is only able to be installed by downloading a GitHub repository and manually following the installation guide (both video and written guides are available on the repository).

- Pre-built versions are only currently available for some Windows GPUs.

- Linux users will need to build Instant NeRF themselves following the repository guide.","{3D Models, AI, Camera, Digital Twin, Free, Local Software, Monitoring, NeRF, Open Source, Photogrammetry, Processing, Real-Time Rendering, Scanning, Visualization}","{Architecture - Open Source, Interfaces - VR, Pricing - Permissive License, Processing - AI, Processing - JSON Keyframes, Processing - NeRF, Processing - Photogrammetry, Processing - Videos, Rendering - Animation Tools, Support - Guides}",,,
10010,Mavlink,Drone Code Foundation,Lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones and between onboard drone components.,"MAVLink is a lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones (and between onboard drone components).

MAVLink follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern: Data streams are sent / published as topics while configuration sub-protocols such as the mission protocol or parameter protocol are point-to-point with retransmission.

Messages are defined within XML files. Each XML file defines the message set supported by a particular MAVLink system, also referred to as a ""dialect"". The reference message set that is implemented by most ground control stations and autopilots is defined in common.xml (most dialects build on top of this definition).

Code generators create software libraries for specific programming languages from these XML message definitions, which can then be used by drones, ground control stations, and other MAVLink systems to communicate. The generated libraries are typically MIT-licensed, and can therefore be used without limits in any closed-source application without publishing the source code of the closed-source application.","{Flight Control, Free, Local Software, On-Board Software, Open Source, Operations}",,,,{PX4}

These functions are included as part of the standard installation and require no additional extensions or plug-in components.

- Linear Profiling/Line of Sight
- Any line feature on the map can be profiled to create a cross-sectional view of the underlying terrain. These profiles can be used to calculate a variety of statistics related to the elevation and slope along the path. Additionally, line of sight calculation can be used to visualize any obstructions that may interfere with the view along the profile path. This is especially useful for the analysis of a radio or broadcast signal. A visualization option allows the Path Profile display to be rendered as a terrain cutaway in the 3D View.
- View Shed Calculation
- Similar to the line of sight calculation, the viewshed analysis tool is typically used to determine the area covered, or not covered, from a broadcast site with a specified transmitter height. The viewshed analysis determines the coverage in all directions within a specified radius from the signal source. Advanced options include Fresnel Zone determination and signal strength loss over distance.
- Watershed Delineation
- Based on the terrain morphology, the watershed calculation tool determines the likely linear path of streams and the drainage or catchment areas of those streams. This tool can also be used to conduct water drop analysis, in which the theoretical flow pattern from a defined source can be mapped.
- Contour Creation
- Any imported or processed elevation layer can be used to generate contours in vector format. Options include customized contour interval spacing and polygon feature generation for determining the area above or below a specified height. The contouring tool can also be used to identify local peaks and depressions in a terrain layer.
- Cut and Fill Calculation
- This powerful tool is used to precisely calculate the volume of material that must be cut and/or filled to flatten the terrain at a specified elevation. Cut and fill calculations can be performed on area features or along a line to simulate the digging of a trench. An optional feature allows the calculation of the break-even height within an area. This represents the elevation value at which the cut and fill volumes will be the same.
- Terrain Modification/Flattening
- An elevation or z-value assigned to an area feature can be used to create an artificial horizontal plane in the terrain. This modified terrain modeling capability is particularly useful for visualizing construction sites or road cuts.
- Sea Level Rise
- This simple visualization tool provides the means to gauge the impact of a rise in water level in the area surrounding a body of water.] , [feature name: Tiling and Mosaicking, feature description: Both the tiling and mosaicking of data in Global Mapper can be completed during the export of data to a supported format.

10030,UgCS,SPH Engineering,Comprehensive drone flight planning and control software.,"UgCS is a comprehensive software suite for drone flight planning and control.

Automated drone mission planning, built-in Photogrammetry and Geotagging tools, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and KML file import enables map customization, and battery change option for long routes make UgCS an effective solution for large area surveying.

Map customization - Offline usage

Create routes from KML
KML files with boundaries of the survey area can be imported into UgCS to set precise survey location. “LineString” segments of the KML file will be imported as simple Waypoint route. “LinearRing” segment can be imported as “Area scan”,“Photogrammetry” or “Perimeter” route type.

Plan surveys with Terrain following
UgCS enables mission planning in Terrain-following mode - enabling a very-low- flying vehicle to automatically maintain a relatively constant altitude above ground level. The accuracy of the default SRTM database of UgCS varies, therefore to enable precise and safe flight altitude precise DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data has to be imported of the survey area.

Import DEM for safer mission planning
The terrain is always changing, but changes are not always implemented into 3D maps as fast as it is needed. To plan an automated low altitude or mission with terrain following for the purposes of mapping, surveying or monitoring, import Digital Elevation Model (DEM) into UgCS to plan safe missions.

Georeferenced image import as Map overlays
To fly automated drone missions precise maps are more important than ever. Import GeoTIFF images as map overlay into UgCS, providing the power to customize the maps to suit your needs. 

Mission planner | Drone control

Immersive 3D mission planning environment
UgCS features mission planner with a Google Earth-like 3D interface for UAV mission planning, enabling to navigate the environment more easily. Moreover, a 3D mission planning environment gives more control allowing to view the created flight plan from all angles, taking into account any obstacles such as terrain or buildings.

Drone survey planning tools
UgCS offers tools to make aerial surveys and mapping as easy and effortless as possible. Choose one of the pre-installed camera profiles or create a new one to suit your camera. The LiDAR, Photogrammetry, Corridor mapping, Vertical scan, and Area Scan tools will automatically calculate the flight path based on the drone and camera settings. Alternatively, the Area Scan and Photogrammetry parameters can be adjusted manually, such as GSD, overlap, or desired altitude.

Facade scan tool
The tool for vertical scanning allows to plan a vertical plane, specify the distance to the wall, as well as side and forward overlap. The optimal flying path is calculated automatically. UgCS supports importing 3D object and custom DEM data with the terrain following function. The tool is also extremely useful in mining for examining open quarries.

Telemetry window
The telemetry data window in UgCS displays telemetry data including the charge level of the battery, radio link and GPS signal quality, current course and heading, speed, altitude and much more.

Elevation profile
Once UgCS completes the flight path calculation the elevation profile of the route displays the AGL and AMSL altitude of the drone. The exact altitudes above sea level at all points provides the ability to plan drone missions with respect to the surrounding.

Automatic flight mode (waypoints) and direct drone control
UgCS enables multiple flight modes. The manual flight mode allows controlling the drone with the remote control. Once a flight plan is created and uploaded to the autopilot the Automatic flight mode can be used. For many drones, UgCS also supports Click&Go and Joystick control flight modes.

Software emulator
There are in-built software emulators for quadrocopters and fixed wing drones -emucopter and emuplane. It enables to test a route before uploading it to a real drone. Feel free to test diverse features and settings of UgCS in a safe environment.

Post-flight analysis and Image processing

Geotagging
UgCS has an in-build geotagging tool, allowing to sync the timestamps of the images with the autopilot's telemetry data recorded during the flight. After matching the geotags with coordinates and correct altitudes, the images can be used for the further processing. Create map overlays or 3D models to import them into UgCS for more precise mission planning.

Telemetry player
All telemetry data of the flights is recorded in UgCS, enabling to replay the flights of the drone during the flight.

No-Fly zones

No-Fly zones - airport registry
UgCS has built-in No-Fly zones (NFZ) for all major airports, enabling a safe flight planning near airports since the flight path will automatically be calculated around the no-fly zone. Airport no-fly zones can be disabled in UgCS PRO and UgCS ENTERPRISE.

Create custom No-Fly zones
UgCS option to create own custom no-fly zones (NFZ) enables to specify regions where flights are prohibited. UgCS will automatically calculate flight path avoiding these areas and make sure that the drone does not enter NFZ while on an automated flight.

Fly zone limits for routes
Set boundaries for the flights starting from the first waypoint. Fly zone limits for routes feature gives the ability to control, that the drone does not fly too far away or higher than desired, according to local regulation.","{Android, Autonomous, Camera, Data Collection, DEM, DSM, DTM, Flight Control, Free Trial, GCP, Inspection, Lidar, Local Software, macOS, Mission Planning, Orthomosaic, Perpetual License, Photogrammetry, RTK, SDK, Subscription, Surveying, Windows}",,"{ [feature name: Additional, feature description: - Up to 10 simultaneous drone connections

10036,Meshroom,Alice Vision,"Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the AliceVision framework.","AliceVision is a free Photogrammetric Computer Vision Framework which provides 3D Reconstruction and Camera Tracking algorithms. It’s built on top of an underlying framework called AliceVision, which is the result of cooperation between multiple Universities & Labs (Czech Technical University, IMAGINE, INPT, Simula Research Laboratory, and Quine) and Mikros Image, a French post-production company.

The basic interaction is about as simple as it gets. Drag and drop pictures into the Meshroom window, hit START and wait for the finished model. However, with Meshroom you can also peform Augmented reconstruction. That means you can add more pictures to a half-finished solution in case you notice (in the preview) that some areas could use more detail.

And even better, with Meshroom you can do Live Reconstruction! In this mode, you repeatedly take sets of pictures, upload them to a folder and they are automatically processed. A preview is displayed and you can decide which part of the model needs more detail. Then, you take more pictures and the whole process repeats until you’ve captured the model from all angles.

Importing images into Meshroom is simply a drag & drop from your images folder into Meshroom. Your Meshroom projects will be saved in a folder called MeshroomCache. And that’s pretty much it! Meshroom will go through your images’ metadata to ensure they are all in order and get to work processing the 3D image.

Whatever is uploaded is automatically opened in Meshroom’s UI. You can then go through in more detail and see what images correspond to what location on the 3D scan. The examination of individual images in the 3D scan gives you more control and a better idea of what looks good and what doesn't.

Make sure to explore the different node functions and how they can be used to improve or change your image. After you are satisfied with the results, go to the next step: uploading straight to Sketchfab.

Meshroom has a feature where you can directly upload your image results to Sketchfab to publish your 3D models and projects.","{3D Models, Camera, Free, Linux, Local Software, macOS, Open Source, Photogrammetry, Processing, Windows}",,,,{Sketchfab}

10042,fieldmargin,Field Margin,Easy-to-use farm management software that is flexible enough to record everything that happens on your farm.,"Fieldmargin is a farming platform that provides several tools to help farmers manage and track their farm operations. The mapping tool allows users to create a digital map of their farm, including fields and features, and share it with their team. The platform automatically records length and area measurements and allows users to record crops or livestock in their fields, make cropping plans, and refer to past cropping data. The reporting feature allows users to access all their farm records in one place and track input use per field and cross-farm, monitor input use for compliance, easily check which jobs an input was used on, and review what was applied to fields by year for costings. The Plan Farm Work tool helps farmers plan and track their field work and other tasks on the farm, with a field history feature that keeps a timeline of everything that has been done in a field. The Livestock Management tool allows farmers to record and track animal numbers, locations, and movements on their farm, and helps them monitor herd movements and calculate field rest days. The Scouting and Measurement tool allows users to create located notes with pictures for scouting and tracking observations and issues on the farm, and to set up monitoring sites to track data on the farm. The tool also allows users to use satellite imagery to spot problems and go directly to the issue when in the field.

Mapping
A digital mapping tool that allows users to create a map of their farm, including fields and features, and share it with their team. The map is accessible on smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Users can quickly and easily map their farm in just 30 minutes (UK only) by importing field boundaries from RPA or John Deere and adding detail with features such as fences, gateways, buildings, and water pipes. The platform automatically records length and area measurements. Users can give access to their farm map to workers, agronomists, advisers, or contractors and access it on their own devices, saving time and helping team members navigate and avoid hazards. GeoMaps also allows users to record crops or livestock in their fields, make cropping plans, and refer to past cropping data to ensure proper rotations. Fields can be divided into sub-fields for various purposes, and users can set field usages, grazing, and field jobs per sub-field for more detailed records. All farm map information can be stored in one place by uploading scanned maps or PDFs, drone imagery using the Drone Deploy integration, yield maps, and regularly updated NDVI analysis with Field Health.

Reporting
A reporting feature that allows users to access all their farm records in one place, ready for use in ordering, costings, benchmarking, or auditing. The platform helps users focus on understanding the impact of their actions on performance rather than searching through paperwork. Users can track input use per field and cross-farm, monitor input use to ensure compliance with legal limits, easily check which jobs an input was used on, know the amount of product required for the season, and review what was applied to fields by year for costings. The platform also automatically records who completed a job and when it was completed. Users can record and compare yields by field, automatically calculate the farm's total yield, visualize yield data with graphs to compare performance, and record yield data over the years. Fieldmargin also provides a history of each field and allows users to easily look back at work done on fields. Users can generate spreadsheets of their reports for paper copies, costings analysis, gross margin calculation, and farm benchmarking.

Plan Farm Work
Helps farmers plan and track their field work and other tasks on the farm. It allows users to plan key field operations, input information about materials used, add comments and photos, and use a personal to-do list to stay organized. It also has a field history feature that keeps a timeline of everything that has been done in a field. The goal of the tool is to help farmers spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on farming.

Livestock Management
The livestock management tool allows farmers to record and track animal numbers, locations, and movements on their farm. It enables users to set up herds with animal type and count, and to record the location of animals on a map. The tool also helps farmers monitor herd movements and calculate field rest days to estimate grazing availability. Additionally, it allows users to record important information such as livestock treatments and pasture productivity improvements, and to track hay and silage yields. This tool is useful for managing various types of livestock, including sheep, cattle, and horses.

Scouting and Measurement
Allows users to create located notes with pictures for scouting and tracking observations and issues on the farm. These notes can be quickly recorded and include photos to show details of the issue. Users can use their phone location to drop a pin or draw a shape on a map to show problem areas. The tool also allows users to tag team members to get their opinion on a problem, share notes with team members or advisers, and set up monitoring sites to track data on the farm. Additionally, users can use satellite imagery to spot problems like disease or nutrient deficiencies earlier, go directly to the issue when in the field, and understand how much of their field is affected by issues spotted. The tool helps users avoid losing notes by storing them in one place.","{Agriculture, Analysis, Data Management, Free Trial, Inspection, Mapping, Monitoring, Operations, Reporting, Scanning, Subscription, Surveying, Visualization}",,,"{ [price name: Essentials, price: 11.66  / month - billed annually, price notes: $13.00 per month per farm - billed monthly
